                        Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
						Responsive design means designing a site to display properly in all potential browsers and devices of users. 
						In this method, the appearance of the site is changed according to the dimensions of the user's screen and 
						other sections are adjusted accordingly so that we do not have additional clutter and movement in different sizes. 
						Web pages that have this feature are called responsive.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>
                        How does responsive design relate to web technologies? 
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Today, web technology has become ubiquitous and continues to expand. 
						This technology can be used on a wide range of devices with different operating systems and 
						different applications and sizes. So web pages should be able to run on different screen sizes. 
						This is where responsive design comes in handy and makes our web pages work well in a variety of sizes. 
						In fact, thanks to responsive design, we can provide the user with a 
						similar experience of working with the system application without writing side programs.

                        What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your 
                        research?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Web applications are an Internet application and can be easily accessed and run through any browser. 
						Web applications should be compatible with different devices and provide a user experience similar to native applications. 
						Basically, web applications are applications that can only be used through the web. More attention is paid to the performance and 
						functionality of web applications, and their content is not so important and is usually not full of content. 
						For example, Gmail is a popular web application. Web applications allow Internet users to access business information from anywhere, anytime, day or night. 
						The web application, after analyzing and reviewing a collection and specifying the exact roles, functions, etc., 
						is designed for that collection and can be provided on the internal network and the Internet.

                    <p>
                       In this course, I have learned a lot about web and web development. I have learned and worked with the most important web development tools.
					   I have got familiar with JavaScript and, like any other programming language, I have worked with its basic and fundamental concepts. 
					   I have learned how to use variables and classes. And how to work with objects, arrays, and strings. Of course, you can not expect to learn all this information in just a few months, but this course can be a great start for future professional developers. 
					   In the following, I have learned very good information about HTML5 and CSS3 and Ajax technology. And now I can create forms and use the elements in these forms, such as text box, check box, combo box, radio button and other elements, to get exactly what I need.
